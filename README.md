# Hello :wave:

## AboutMe

I am Abdulsalam Tahlil, a student pursuing my Bachelor's in **Computer Science** at Wentworth Institute of Technology, and I will graduate in 2027.  

:technologist: My passion extends beyond coding into creating various projects like **games**, **clothes**, **lamps**, and **videos**. One of my notable creations includes a mini voice assistant capable of playing specific songs from my hard drive upon hearing certain keywords.

Beyond technology, I challenge myself with creative pursuits such as learning animation in Blender and video editing using Premiere Pro. I continuously expand my coding skills and maintain an active presence on **GitHub**, showcasing my projects. Additionally, I contribute to the underground fashion scene by **designing** and **releasing** clothing.

:books: In my downtime, I indulge in reading, with a particular fondness for ** James Patterson's Alex Cross** detective series. I appreciate the gritty realism and intricate details woven throughout the novels.
